        <p>Drivera is a comprehensive driving school management app designed to streamline and simplify the management processes for driving school owners. It offers a range of features and functionalities to efficiently manage various aspects of a driving school, including student management, scheduling, reminders, payments, and exams.</p>
    
        <p>With Drivera, driving school owners can create an account by providing their personal information and driving school details. Once logged in, they can activate the categories their driving school offers, such as beginner's courses, advanced courses, or defensive driving. They can also add vehicles to their school's fleet, including relevant details like make, model, license plate number, and availability.</p>
        
        <p>Drivera allows driving school owners to add monitors to their team, along with their contact information. They can then add students to the system, including their personal details and assign them to specific monitors. This enables effective student management and ensures a personalized learning experience.</p>
        
        <p>The scheduling feature in Drivera enables driving school owners to create lesson plans and assign monitors and vehicles to each lesson. This helps in efficiently managing the driving school's schedule and ensuring smooth operations. Reminders for upcoming lessons, exams, or important events related to the driving school are also provided to keep everyone informed.</p>
        
        <p>Drivera facilitates payment management, allowing driving school owners to handle payments from students. They can track payment status, generate invoices, and ensure a seamless payment process. Additionally, Drivera provides a list of exams for students, including exam dates, scores, and results, enabling efficient tracking of their progress.</p>
        
        <p>Furthermore, Drivera offers limited access to monitors by providing them with a password. Monitors can log in to the app, although they have restricted permissions. While they can access certain features, they are unable to add students. This feature ensures secure access and allows monitors to stay updated without compromising sensitive information.</p>
